## Description 

Play Trade is an app designed to educate users on the stock market and help build confidence when you begin making your investments. A user can build a fake portfolio using real stock market data and see their portfolio grow or shrink over time. This allows anyone to practice and gain confidence in their ability to invest and navigate the market.

We all have a friend or family members who are interested in stocks but are too scared to invest real money. Play Trade is the perfect app to immerse yourself in the stock market without the fear of losing money. Now anyone can claim to be a market genius, study market trends, and make wise long-term investments without gambling real money.
